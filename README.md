# Bubble-Translator

This is a little project I made where a floating bubble sits on your screen. You can drag it anywhere you want, and when you click it, a translator window pops up.

# Updates

- The translator window now never hides off-screen, it moves back just enough so you can always see the "X" close button.

# Requirements

- Python 3.8+

- deep-translator (pip install deep-translator)

My recommendation: run it with Code Runner in VS Code, it makes testing way smoother.
